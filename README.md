The Odeon Cinema requires a booking management system to handle:

Screens & Seats: 6 screens, each with 50 seats (10 VIP).

Showtimes: 4 shows per day (afternoon, evening, 2 at night).

Ticket Booking: Customers choose showtime, pricing varies (afternoon cheapest, first night most expensive).

Payments: By credit card or cash. Customers may reschedule if seats are available.

Reviews: After a show, customers can leave written reviews and give a 1â€“5 rating.

Reports (monthly):

Number of spectators per film + average rating.

Film generating the highest income.

ðŸ‘‰ Essentially, the system must manage ticket booking, payments, rescheduling, customer reviews, and monthly reports.
